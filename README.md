poi
=====

yay a 2d poi pattern grapher!

hella work in progress

ideas / todos
-----
+ slight hand offsets and positioning relative to body? I want this to make it easier for noobs like me to figure out how their hands should interact with each other especially when crossing over
+ allow arbitrary pattern phase shifts (I'm writing the pattern generators pretty modularly so this should follow naturally)
+ refactor to make specifications for stalls and other directional changes easy, probably some kind of chaining mechanism that auto-normalizes itself to overall period.
+ implement "your arms can't do that" detector (involves reverse engineering sneaky ways in which people fold poi around their bodies)
+ beat detection and counter
+ FORCE DIAGRAMS AND GRAVITY OHHH
