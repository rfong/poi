poi
=====

yay a 2d poi pattern grapher!

hella work in progress

practical todos
-----
+ ~~selectable patterns~~
+ ~~split/together/same time selector~~ (pattern phase shift)
+ ~~rotate the graph to make theta=0 point up~~
+ more patterns. [ideas](https://github.com/infiniteperplexity/visual-spinner-3d/tree/master/json)
+ ~~refactor so the speed is changeable~~
+ change poi to arm ratio
+ urlparams for permalinking

pipe dreams / ideas
-----
+ FORCE DIAGRAMS AND GRAVITY OHHH SNAP
+ beat detection and counter
+ ~~RAVE MODE~~
+ Fourier transform arbitrary shapes into what you have to do with your hands over a long exposure and tell you how many cycles it would take
+ slight hand offsets and positioning relative to body? I want this to make it easier for noobs like me to figure out how their hands should interact with each other especially when crossing over
+ write a constraint solver to animate someone's arms attached to the handles? this would be fun and silly but might discourage creativity and good body movement
+ allow arbitrary pattern phase shifts and n-flowers (I'm writing the pattern generators pretty modularly so this should follow naturally)
+ refactor to make specifications for stalls and other directional changes easy, probably some kind of chaining mechanism that auto-normalizes itself to overall period.
+ implement "your arms can't do that" detector (involves reverse engineering sneaky ways in which people fold poi around their bodies)
+ idk what if I made a polar equation validator that people could input patterns into so I don't have to figure all of them out myself
